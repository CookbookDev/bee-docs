After [purchasing a batch of postage stamps](/docs/desktop/postage-stamps) you will be able to upload files. First go to the “Files” tab. Here you can choose between three options, depending on what you want to upload: a single file, a folder or a website. After choosing your option you’ll need to add a postage stamp.
