Accessing content on Swarm using Swarm Desktop is easy. All you need to get started is the Swarm hash for the content you wish to access. Whenever content is [uploaded to Swarm](/docs/desktop/upload-content) a Swarm hash is generated as a reference to that content. 

To access content on Swarm go to the ***Files*** tab and click ***Download***:

From there, paste the Swarm hash for the content you want to access, and click ***Find***. We'll use the hash for a Swarm blog post explaining how to upload a website to Swarm:

On the following screen you will see the data associated with the Swarm hash and see options for downloading (or browsing if it is a hash for a website):

Click ***View Website*** to see the site in your browser, or ***Download*** to download the files:
