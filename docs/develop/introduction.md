# Swarm

## Swarm Whitepaper and The Book of Swarm

What happens with a Bee node after startup? Want to know more about the Swarm technology behind Bee?
Want to make your own client? Read the <a href="/swarm-whitepaper.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Swarm Whitepaper</a> and for a deeper dive, <a href="/the-book-of-swarm.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Book of Swarm</a>,
our 250 page guide to the tech underpinning the Swarm network.

## Bonding Curve

Find more information on the bonding curve, including its [source code](https://github.com/ethersphere/bzzaar-contracts) in the github repository.

# Bee

## Working With Bee

Once Bee is installed, find out how to configure the software, interact with the API, monitor what Bee is up to, and make those all important backups in the [working with Bee](/docs/bee/working-with-bee/introduction) section.

## Access the Swarm

To learn more about how to get the most out of Bee, find out how to [access the swarm](/docs/develop/access-the-swarm/upload-and-download) section so you can share files with your friends, use Bee to host a website on a public Swarm Gateway, and much more!

## API Reference

[Find detailed information](/docs/api-reference/) on all the endpoints available in the autogenerated <a href="/api" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">API reference</a> and <a href="/debug-api" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Debug API reference</a> guides.

## Dapps

Swarm is all about dapps. It strives to provide the most developer
friendly environment on which to build decentralised
organisations. Built on the principles of functionality, flexibility
and accessibility, Bee provides high level constructs for file
storage, feeds and key-value stores, while also providing the low
level access with libraries that create Single Owner and Trojan chunks
clientside, with total e2e privacy. Learn more about how to [develop
on Swarm](/docs/develop/dapps-on-swarm/introduction).
 

## Development

Join our efforts! Are you up to the challenge of
helping to create Bee and the other incredible technologies that are
being build on top of it? You are invited to contribute code to the Bee
client or any of the other projects in Swarm's
[Ethersphere](https://github.com/ethersphere).
