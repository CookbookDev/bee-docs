The [Gateway Proxy tool](https://github.com/ethersphere/gateway-proxy) is more than just a proxy, it offers a range of useful functionalities for node operators and Swarm developers. For more in depth documentation of its features, refer to its [README doc](https://github.com/ethersphere/gateway-proxy/blob/master/README.md) on GitHub.

### Public Gateway

The tool can be used to set up a public gateway which can be used to host public facing applications or websites to users on the web who aren't running Bee nodes.

### Stamp Management

In addition to acting as a proxy, it also includes convenient features for managing stamps such as automatically buying new stamps or automatically extending the life of existing stamps.

### Security

Authentication can also be enabled so that only authorized requests are fulfilled. This is a useful feature for protecting your node if its API endpoint is publicly exposed.
