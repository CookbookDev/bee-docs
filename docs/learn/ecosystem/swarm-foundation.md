## Swarm Foundation

The goal of [Swarm Foundation](https://www.ethswarm.org/foundation) is to support and contribute to the creation of technology whose code will be open to all and will allow the storage and exchange of data in a decentralised manner. To this end, the foundation intends in particular to promote and support a community and a sustainable and independent ecosystem for the development of free open source software (FLOSS), allowing for digital services coordinated by crypto-economic incentives that process, distribute and store data.

Its mission is to empower digital freedom by promoting the development and maintenance of the Swarm network, the base layer of the emerging fair data economy, and the community surrounding this network.

It does so by supporting many different initiatives, either through financial grants or other types of support, all of which is assessed on a case-by-case basis.
