The [postage stamp contract](https://github.com/ethersphere/storage-incentives/blob/master/src/PostageStamp.sol) is a smart contract which is a key part of Swarm's [storage incentives](/docs/learn/technology/incentives) which make up the foundation of Swarm's self-sustaining economic system. It allows users to purchase batches of postage stamps for xBZZ tokens. These stamps can then be used to attach to [chunks](/docs/learn/technology/DISC) that are uploaded to the Swarm network.

When a node uploads data to Swarm, it attaches postage stamps to each chunk of data. Postage stamps are issued in batches rather than one by one. The value assigned to a stamp indicates how much it is worth to persist the associated data on Swarm, which nodes use to prioritize which chunks to remove from their reserve first.

The value of a postage stamp decreases over time as if storage rent was regularly deducted from the batch balance. Once the value of a stamp is no longer sufficient, the associated chunk is evicted from the reserve.


### How Postage Stamps Work

Postage stamps are issued in batches which are distributed amongst a set of buckets. The number of buckets for all batches is set by the bucket depth constant of 16. The entire Swarm address space is divided into $$2^{bucket depth}$$ different buckets. When uploaded, files are split into 4kb chunks and assigned to a specific bucket based on the chunk's address. 

Each batch of stamps has two key parameters, `depth` and `amount`, which are recorded on Gnosis Chain at issuance.

### Batch Depth 

Batch depth is a measurement of how much data can be stored by a batch. The number of chunks which can be stored (stamped) by a batch is equal to  $$2^{depth}$$. 

Batch depth determines how many chunks are allowed in each bucket. The number of chunks allowed in each bucket is calculated like so:

$$2^{(batch depth - bucket depth)}$$

*Example: Batch depth = 20*

For a batch with a batch depth of 20, a maximum of $$2^{20} = 1,048,576$$ chunks can be stamped.   

Given the constant bucket depth of 16, for a batch depth of 20, the number of chunks per bucket is calculated like so:

$$2^{(20 - 16)} = 16 \text{ chunks/bucket}$$

Since we know that one chunk can store 4 kb of data, we can easily calculate the maximum amount of data (due to [the details of the Swarm protocol](/docs/learn/technology/contracts/postage-stamp), postage batches may be fully utilized before storing the maximum amount of data) which can be stored by a batch from the batch depth:

$$
\text{Maximum data in a batch} = 2^{batchdepth} \times \text{4 kb}   
$$

For a batch of depth 16, for example, the maximum amount of data in kilobytes can be calculated like so:

$$
2^{16} \times \text{4 kb} = 65536 \text{ chunks} \times \text{4 kb} = \text{262144 kb}
$$

### Amount

The *amount* parameter is the quantity of xBZZ in PLUR $$(1 \times 10^{16}PLUR = 1 \text{ xBZZ})$$ that is assigned per chunk in the batch. The total amount of xBZZ that will be paid for the batch is calculated from this figure and the batch depth like so:

$$2^{batch depth} \times {amount}$$

The paid amount forms the `balance` of the batch. This `balance` is then slowly depleted as time ticks on and blocks are mined on Gnosis Chain.

For example, with a batch depth of 20 and an amount of 1000000000 PLUR:

$$
2^{20} \times 1000000000 = 1048576000000000 \text{ PLUR} = 0.1048576 \text{ xBZZ}
$$
