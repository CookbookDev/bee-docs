### DAI 

DAI is the popular decentralized stablecoin from [MakerDAO](https://makerdao.com/en/).

### xDAI

xDAI is the bridged version of DAI on Gnosis Chain and also serves as the native gas token for Gnosis Chain and is used to pay transaction fees on Gnosis Chain in the same way ETH is used to pay for transactions on Ethereum. It is required by Bee nodes to pay for transaction fees when interacting with Swarm smart contracts on Gnosis Chain.


### Getting BZZ / xBZZ

The Swarm official website has a page with [a list of resources for getting BZZ tokens](https://www.ethswarm.org/get-bzz). Be careful to check whether it is BZZ on Ethereum or Gnosis Chain.


### Bridging BZZ or DAI

If you already have DAI or BZZ on Ethereum then you can use one of the Gnosis Chain bridges to swap for the bridged version of each token on Gnosis Chain (or vice versa). You can use either [xDAI Bridge](https://bridge.gnosischain.com/) or [OmniBridge](https://omni.gnosischain.com/bridge) for swapping between DAI and xDAI or BZZ and xBZZ.
